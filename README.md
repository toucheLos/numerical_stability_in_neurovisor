To Do:

1.) Complete Euler Implementation
 - Make sure it works

2.) Compare Voltages with NeuroVISOR
 - Remember that this is a single compartment neuron
  - Recreate this scenario in NeuroVISOR
  - Ensure starting voltage and Istim are constant between programs

3.) Add all gating variables to Magdelena's model
 - This will give greater clarity on where the root of the instability it

4.) If program results do not match for later ion channels (Slow K, Low-T Calcium), but do match for base Na and K, check implementation in NeuroVISOR. 

5.) Check for instabilities in numpy program
